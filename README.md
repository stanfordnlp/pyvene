# A Library for _Understanding_ and _Improving_ PyTorch Models via Interventions

**pyvene** is an open-source Python library for intervening on the internal states of
PyTorch models. Interventions are an important operation in many areas of AI, including
model editing, steering, robustness, and interpretability.

pyvene has many features that make interventions easy:

- Interventions are the basic primitive, specified as dicts and thus able to be saved locally
  and shared as serialisable objects through HuggingFace.
- Interventions can be composed and customised: you can run them on multiple locations, on arbitrary
  sets of neurons (or other levels of granularity), in parallel or in sequence, on decoding steps of
  generative language models, etc.
- Interventions work out-of-the-box on any PyTorch model! No need to define new model classes from
  scratch and easy interventions are possible all kinds of architectures (RNNs, ResNets, CNNs, Mamba).

pyvene is under active development and constantly being improved ðŸ«¡

## Installation

To install the latest stable version of pyvene:

```
pip install pyvene
```

Alternatively, to install a bleeding-edge version, you can clone the repo and install:

```
git clone git@github.com:stanfordnlp/pyvene.git
cd pyvene
pip install -e .
```

When you want to update, you can just run `git pull` in the cloned directory.

We suggest importing the library as:

```
import pyvene as pv
```
